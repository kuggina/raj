*Azure Pipelines*

1. what is pipeline ?
a)Pipelines are used to complete the tasks.
With the help of Pipelines we can able to customize the tasks.
Here we have a 2 types of pipelines are availble. those Azure
1. Build Pipelines
2. Release Pipelines.

Manuval Pipelines : Build and Relase.
Automatic Pipelines : CI and CD.

We have a multiple tools are availble in to create a CI and CD pipelines.
  1. Jenkins - AWS Devops Engineer.
  2. Azure Pipelines : Azure Devops Engineer.
  3. Bamboo : License needs to purchase.
  4. Gitlab :License needs to purchase.

Jenkins :
- Open source 
- Supports only Java projects
- we need to integrate all the devops tools.
- with the help of plugins we can able to integrate.
- we are the resposbile person for manageing the jenkins.
- It doesnt support the MAC OS projects

Azure Pipelines : 
- License
- Supports all type of programming Language
- all the devops tools we get inbuilt.
- we no need to use any pluguins to integrate the devops tools
- Microsoft is responsbile for managing the Azure Pipelines
- It support the MAC OS projects

Build Pipelines : This is used for convert the application raw code into machine undestandbul code i.e. Package.

Release Pipelines : This is used for deploying the artifact into multiple servers ( Multiple Stages / Environments)

2. Explain about ci and cd pipelines?
a)

CI Means Contuinous Integration.
with the help of this we can automate the builds and tasks.
When the deveopler make any changes into the source code automatically build will be triggered and artifact will be 
generated this process is called as CI.
Here We need to be enabled CI Option in Trigeer section.
In this CI process we are using the Self Hosted Agents.


CD Means Contuinous Deployment.
When the CI is completed then artifact will be generated that artifact will be deployed into multiple Environments
this process we called as a CD.
Here We need to Enable the CD option in Artifcat Section.
Here We are using the Azure Webapps for CD purpose.
Here We are using the below Stages / Environments
Dev,QA,UAT,Non Prod,Prod.

Build Pipelines : With the help of multiple tasks we can convert the application code into package this process
                  is called as a Build Pipelines and this build Pipelines output is called as a "Artifact".
                  This complete process we are doing via Manuvally.
CI              : when the eveloper make any changes into the source code automatically Build Pipelines
                  will triggered and artifact will be generated this process we called as a CI.
                  CI Means Contunious Integration.

if we run Build / CI pipelines we are using the SHA / MHA.
                    
Relase Pipelines : once the Build Pipelines is completed then we will get the Artifact that Artifact will be
                   deployed into multiple environments / Stages by Manuvally.

CD ( Contunious Deployment) : once the Build Pipelines is completed then we will get the Artifact that Artifact will be
                   deployed into multiple environments / Stages via Automatic.

We have a multiple environments those are like :

Dev : Development.
QA : Quality Assurence.
UAT : User acceptence test.
PREF : Performance.
INFOSEC : Informtion Security.
Pre Prod / Non Prod : Observation of your application.
Prod : Live Application.

3. what are the tasks you are using in the Build & relase pipelines?

Build Pipelines  / CI pipelines Tasks :

1. Dependcies Task : ASP.NET project "NUGET".
                   : Java Project "Maven"
2. Build Solution Task : MS Build tools
                         POM.xml & Settings.xml
3. Code Covarage Task : Sonar cloud tools
4. Test Plans Task : Selinum Test cases / VS Test cases.
5. Publish Artifact Task : Final output Package / Artifact.

Relase Pipeline / CD pipelines : 
1. Deploy into azure webapps.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



4. what is agent ? how many types of agents are availble ?

Build Creation with the Help  of MHA Agent in azure Pipelines :

if you want to run a Build or release pipelines we need a agent.

Agent is nothing but a server / vm it consisting the required softwares to run pipelines.

Agent pools : it consiting the multple agents.

Here we have a 2 types of agent pools are availble.
1. ORG Level Agent pools :

   https://dev.azure.com/lenkasureshkumarazdevops/_settings/agentpools
   
2. Project Lelel Agent Pools

Here We have a 2 types of agents those are 
1. Micro soft hosted Agent (MHA) : Azure Pipelines means MHA.
2. Self Hosted Agent (SHA) : Default or any other name.

In this Azure Devops portal we have a Azure Pipelines option.

Here Pipelines option is used for Build and CI pipelines creation purpose.
Here Relase option is used for Relase and CD pipelines creation purpose.

What are the possible ways we have a to failed the Build Pipeline ?
- Wrong Repos Seclection
- Agent is Not availble
- Unable to fetch the dependcies.
- Wrongly assigned Varibales.
- MSBuild Arguments path also incorrect
- Solution file path is incorrect.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. what is the difference between the SHA & MHA

Microsoft Hosted Agents
1.Microsoft is responsble for providing the agents
2.microsoft is responsbile for security,patches and updates in agents
3.when the pipeline is created automatically one fresh virtual machines allocated & once the pipeline job done automatically virtualmachine  disappear
4.we don't have full control on the agents
5.all the required softwares installed on agent for run the pipelines
6.pipeline exeuction time is high becayse this is used by all the azure devops users


Self hosted agents
1.We are the responsbile for providing the agents
2.We are the responsbile for security,patches and updates in Agents
3.when the pipeline is created we need to allocated virtual machine & once the pipeline jon is completed still the vm is availble
4.we have a full control on the agents
5.we need to install required softwares for run the pipeline.
6.pipeline exeuction time is less because this is used by ours only


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




6. what is the dirference between the YAML pipeline vs classic pipelines?

Classic:
1. We can create a pipeline based on UI mode
2. 1.0
3. classic pipelines are jason format.
4. all created pipelines are stored in pipeline storage.
5. we can not customized pipeline without access. (contributor access we can not do any action)


YAML
1.We can create a pipeline based on Code
2. 2.0
3. YAML format with (type of XML).
4. all created pipelines in YAML based stored in branch storage.
5. we can do customized pipeline without access. (without contributor access we can do any action).

7.i want to run a pipeline with a specific agent ? with the help of demands
Pending 



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8.i wamnt to schedule a pipelines ?

In the trigger section we have a 3 options :
1. Enable contunioue intergartion
2. schedule
3. Buildafter completeion

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





9. what is Task groups?  (doubt on answer)

Build Pipelines  / CI pipelines Tasks :

1. Dependcies Task : ASP.NET project "NUGET".
                   : Java Project "Maven"
2. Build Solution Task : MS Build tools
                         POM.xml & Settings.xml
3. Code Covarage Task : Sonar cloud tools
4. Test Plans Task : Selinum Test cases / VS Test cases.
5. Publish Artifact Task : Final output Package / Artifact.

Relase Pipeline / CD pipelines : 
1. Deploy into azure webapps.

What are the approaches we have a to create a CI / CD or Build / Relase pipelines ?
We have a 2 approaches those are 
1. Using the Classic Editor 
2. YAML Pipelines


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. what is deployment groups ?
11. what is variable and variable groups ?
12. How do you reslove your production issues ?
